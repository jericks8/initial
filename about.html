  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Bubble under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the summer months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are flowing. We arrange weeends away as small groups to cut the costs of accomodation and travel and to ensure that everyone gets a trustwrothy dive buddy.</p>
  <p>Although we're based in teh sout-west, we dont stay in our own turf: past diving weekends away have included trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malto's numberous wreck sites.</p>
  <p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to talk about our recent adventures (<em>any</em> excuse, eh?).
  <p>Or as our man Bob Dobalina would put it:</p>
  <blockquote>
  	<p>"Happiness is a dip in the ocean followed by a pint or two of Old Speckled Hen. You can quote me on that!"</p>
    </blockquote>
